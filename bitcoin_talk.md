## Why is gold valuable?

### Mises' Regression Theorem

It's valuable because of the use that you perceive it to have in accomplishing your goals. The estimation of a good/money today for purchasing things tomorrow is based on the estimation of the goods/moneys value yesterday in accomplishing that goal. What was the value yesterday? It was estimated based on the value of the day before yesterday. All the way back to Ancient times.

It is still valuable today because it was valued in the past.

*So why was gold valuable in Ancient times?*

### Ancient view of Gold and the Subjective Value Theorem

The Ancient world seemed to view gold as favourable for its divine properties, and its Economic properties were probably either a part of these divine characteristics, or they at least helped gold to be used as a currency, and not just a store of value for Kings.

couldn't be defiled. 

Thus gold was valued for largely religous/mystical reasons. One could call this a subjective evaluation. Perhaps the reason gold was considered to have properties close to the divine is because it also had the properties that Economists now say are necessary for a good to be called/used as "money"

#### Economic Properties
We can see that gold does posess [these properties](https://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/):

* Divisible: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
* Fungible: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
* Portable: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
* Durable: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
* Acceptable: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
* Uniform: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
* Limited in Supply: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.

#### Other Properties

* Transparency: Easy to measure/test its value [Open Source]
* Privacy: Gold can be traded privately
* Security: Gold can be held in the hand, it's value does not deteriorate, this could be viewed as a mystical property.

## What makes Bitcoin Valuable?

### Regression Theorem

Fiat still remained tradeable and was accepted for payment even after it moved off from a gold standard and money lost all utility in itself. In the same way Bitcoin is tradeable and accepted for payment because it is tradeable both with US currency and for real goods.
In this sense, Bitcoin is like USD. Neither of them have use in themselves, their only use is as a medium for trade. If this is considered a weakness in the USD, it could also be seen as a weakness in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin does have use, because it can be used to get what you want. Bitcoin also has the other properties which make it useful as a currency/money.

### Properties of Bitcoin

#### Classical Economic Properties

* Divisible:            Can be divided into smaller units of value.
* Fungible:             One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
* Portable:             Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
* Durable:              An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
* Acceptable:           Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
* Uniform:              All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
* Limited in Supply:    The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.

#### Other Properties

* Transparency:         Open Source
* Privacy:              Both gold and Bitcoin can be private. But Bitcoin is more Private, as you never need to show your face, transactions are visible on the blockchain however, even though the holder of the wallet is not known. This might reveal some information though, especially if it is in large transactions or transactions of a precise size that might have meaning.
* Security:             Bitcoin is guaranteed to be delivered. It has more security potential than gold, as BTC is extremely difficult to steal. Even Quantum computers would find it difficult. The most insecurity comes in storing the keys to wallet addresses. This is more likely if the keys are kept on "exchanges" online. The websites are generally far more vulnerable than the keys to Bitcoin wallet addresses themselves.
